# Netflix clone
A Netflix clone to learn css better

Used rather hacky ways to play videos inside the tv screens, which breaks when changing page zoom.
The main header background image needs to be a bit smaller to be similar to the original Netflix page but eh.
Needs a lot of work here and there like the header tezt width and size but eh seems good nuff.
I'll change stuff if I feel like it and have better experience in css.
